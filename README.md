# Neumorphic-BMI-Calculator

### Demo Link [Here](https://abdul-sen.github.io/Neomorphic-BMI-Calculator/)

This is a small frontend UI project I recently did to accomplish the following:

* Get out of my comfort zone with Material-UI /w React for my projects
* Learn more about styled-components library, in a short time period
* Try my hands at neumorphic design, understanding the the methodology, use cases, and its limitations
* Build something cool :sunglasses:

The app uses Redux to manage the app state. And has both a dark mode and a light mode that looks something as follows:
